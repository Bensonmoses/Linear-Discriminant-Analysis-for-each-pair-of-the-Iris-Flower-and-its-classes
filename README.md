# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-for-each-pair-of-the-Iris-Flower-and-its-classes

I loaded the Iris dataset, checked for missing values (none found), and visualized the data through histograms and scatter plots to understand feature distributions and relationships.

I preprocessed the data by encoding the 'class' column with LabelEncoder and split it into training and testing sets.

I applied Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and trained a Logistic Regression model to classify the Iris species.

Model evaluation involved a confusion matrix and an accuracy score. I also used K-Fold cross-validation with 5 splits and calculated the mean squared error (MSE) to assess model performance.

For improvements, I plan to explore different algorithms, experiment with feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and consider other classification algorithms. Scaling, feature selection, handling class imbalance, and regularization are also on the agenda to enhance model performance.

This summarizes my data analysis and modeling journey with the Iris dataset, aiming for continuous improvement.
